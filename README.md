# QueuesAndStacks
Day 18

Write the following declarations and implementations:

Two instance variables: one for your stack, and one for your queue.
A void pushCharacter(char ch) method that pushes a character onto a stack.
A void enqueueCharacter(char ch) method that enqueues a character in the queue instance variable.
A char popCharacter() method that pops and returns the character at the top of the stack instance variable.
A char dequeueCharacter() method that dequeues and returns the first character in the queue instance variable.

If your code is correctly written and s is a palindrome, the locked stub code will print  
"The string, s, is a palindrome."; otherwise, it will print "The string, s, is a not palindrome."
